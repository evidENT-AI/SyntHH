# SyntHH: Synthetic Hearing Health Data Generation and Validation

## Project Overview

### What is this project?

This project develops and validates methods for generating synthetic audiometric data that preserves the statistical properties of real hearing measurements whilst protecting patient privacy. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we create artificial hearing test data that can be safely shared for research, education, and algorithm development without exposing any actual patient information. This work represents the first translational application of synthetic data in hearing healthcare.

## Background & Problem

### Current Challenge

Hearing health research faces a critical data accessibility paradox. High-quality audiometric datasets are essential for developing better diagnostic tools, understanding hearing loss patterns, and creating personalised treatments. However, these datasets contain sensitive health information that cannot be freely shared due to privacy regulations and ethical constraints. This creates several problems:

- **Limited Collaboration:** Researchers cannot easily share audiometric data between institutions
- **Algorithmic Bias:** Machine learning models trained on restricted datasets may not represent diverse populations
- **Reproducibility Crisis:** Study findings cannot be validated across centres due to data-sharing restrictions
- **Educational Constraints:** Students and developers cannot access realistic hearing data for learning
- **Innovation Barriers:** Startups and smaller institutions cannot access data needed for healthcare innovation

### Our Solution

We develop sophisticated synthetic data generation methods that:

- **Preserve Statistical Properties:** Maintain all important relationships and patterns from real audiometric data
- **Ensure Privacy Protection:** Generate completely artificial data with no connection to real patients
- **Enable Open Sharing:** Create datasets that can be freely distributed for research and development
- **Support Algorithm Development:** Provide unlimited training data for machine learning applications
- **Fill Data Gaps:** Generate examples of rare conditions underrepresented in existing datasets
